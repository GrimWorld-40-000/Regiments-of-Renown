	<description>A uniform of the Armageddon Steel Legion, consisting of a greatcoat (traditionally in the color mustard yellow), boots, and gloves over fatigues. Very good at insulating the wearer against the cold, but it provides little protection against enemy attack. \n\nArmageddon is a battle-scarred world, with a history containing no less than three major wars and uncountable skirmishes against the Ork population and Chaos incursions. As such, the planetâ€™s Guardsmen are weathered and experienced, able to put up a stiff resistance against any threat they face.</description>
