	<description>Standard, dark brown fatigues of the Tempestus Scions. These fatigues are able to endure a little more punishment than regular fatigues, but don’t protect the user from hot or cold temperatures as well - but the Storm Troopers are used to operating under those conditions. \n\nThe Tempestus Scions have little in the way of downtime, being given only the minimum of rest time their bodies need. If they are not being deployed, they spend their days sharpening their skills in training, with a high-tech simulator on their voidship giving them the harshest combat conditions they can withstand - and, occasionally, a little more than that, just to push the envelope. \n\nA Scion would tell you that these brutal combat exercises are indeed what they consider to be recreation - after getting used to running them all day every day, they consider the exercises rather fun.</description>
